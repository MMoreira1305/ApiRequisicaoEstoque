============ ABOUT THIS PROJECT =============

This project is an API that will be used later with the help of colleagues to create the frontend. The project is based on restaurant inventory control, where each sector of that restaurant will no longer need to go to the inventory manager to place an order, they only need to access with their login and password, with their products from a certain sector. The inventory manager will be able to see the orders and place them, after which the orders he has already placed will disappear from his screen.

============ WHAT THE CONSUMER CAN GET AND POST? =============

The API consumer will be able to retrieve product, user and order data. Within products we have sectors, where each sector is directed to a specific area of ​​the restaurant. Within users I can see their name, sector, login and password. Within requests you can see the user, date and time. In another table generated by @ManyToMany I have the order and product relationship with their respective IDs.
